Rose|Tito, there's something odd about this place. You can feel it, too, right?
Tito|Well, it's called "Traitor Joe's." Can't get more suspicious than that!
Rose|Rightâ€¦ like... who's Joe???
Tito|And why's he a traitor?
Rose|Oh, I, um. I think you might've misheard that. It's trader, like a merchant.
Tito|Oh.
Rose|I'm gonna look for Joe. You be safe.

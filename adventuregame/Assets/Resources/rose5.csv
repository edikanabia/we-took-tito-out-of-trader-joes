Rose|Tito, I've got it. Come closer.
Rose|Traitor Joe told us we need a key to escape. Now, take a look around.
Rose|All of these keys are bad keys; they don't work, right?
Rose|Work. Workers. Workers are something a grocery store needs in order to function.
Rose|We are currently in a grocery store, but it's not the same as before. It's a pocket dimension somewhere else.
Rose|Some where. "Some" kinda sorta not really sounds like "um."
Rose|How do you spell um?
Rose|You em. 
Rose|That's right: University of Miami.
Rose|An institution that partnered with the federal government loaning out an island for weapons testing.
Rose|Why did they bomb the island? Because they thought it was beneath them.
Rose|The floor is beneath us and what's on the floor? 
Rose|The keys. Floor keys.
Rose|The Florida Keys are a series of islands beneath Florida. And where are we?
Tito|Black Hole/White Market?
Rose|Yes, well, that is what Traitorous Joseph wants you to think!
Rose|But he said he "calls it" Black Hole/White Market, not that that's what it's actually called!
Rose|Now I should remind you: we're in a pocket dimension. And what else do you put in your pocket?
Rose|A key. 
Rose|One of the keys on the floor is blue. It's a Blue Key.
Rose|Blue Key is a statewide debate competition held annually at the University of Florida.
Rose|Tito. 
Rose|We are in Florida.
Tito|Traitor Joe, is this true?
???|Yes.
Rose|Now, he said, we have to find the right key. The Key that's furthest to the right on a map of the Keys is Key Largo.
Rose|HOWEVER, Traitor Joe is a liar; he's misdirecting us.
Rose|So if we miss his directions, we actually end up with the leftmost key.
Rose|The key to escape…
Rose|…is Key West.
Rose|Got that?
Tito|I think so, but a bit slower-
Rose|The correct key is the one that's shaped like an island.
Tito|Okay!!!
